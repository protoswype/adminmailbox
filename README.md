adminmailbox
============

Theres no ready release yet!

Tool for using postfixadmin.
There's no possibility to change a mailbox-password without being administrator for a domain.
The first goal of this app is to login with a mailbox and the current password and to change the password afterwards.

Please have a look at the wiki to see installation- and further instruction.

Everyone is free to use and modify this app as long as you publish it on the same conditions (like free to everybody).
